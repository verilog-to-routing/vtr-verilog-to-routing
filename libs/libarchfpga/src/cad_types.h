 *                      t_pack_pattern_blocks in this pack pattern as defined in the architecture
 *      block_id      : the id of this t_pack_pattern_block within its pack pattern, used to access

/**
 * Describes a pack pattern defined in the architecture. A pack pattern is an
 * architectural concept that defines a pattern of highly constrained and/or desirable
 * arrangement of primitives that exists within one logic cluster (Ex. CLB).
 *
 * For example: A pack pattern could be a 6-LUT and a FF. Where the architecture
 * file gives a hint for the packer to pack a 6-LUT that is followed by a FF in the
 * netlist together in one logic element. This helps the packer to achieve high
 * packing density. Another example, is a carry chain where the adders in the netlist
 * should be packed together to be able to route Cout to Cin connections using the
 * dedicated wiring in the architecture.
 *
 * Data members:
 *      name              : name given to the pack pattern in the architecture file
 *      index             : id of the pack pattern in the list_of_pack_patterns array defined in the packer code
 *      root_block        : the block defining the starting point of this pattern. For example: for
 *                          a carry chain pattern, it is the primitive driven by a cluster input pin.
 *      base_cost         : the sum of the primitive base costs of all the primitives in this pack pattern.
 *                          The primitive base cost is defined by compute_primitive_base_cost in vpr_utils.cpp 
 *      num_blocks        : total number of primitives in this pack pattern
 *      is_block_optional : [0..num_blocks-1] is true if the t_pack_pattern_block defined by block_id
 *                          is not mandatory for this pack pattern to be formed. For example, in a carry
 *                          chain pack pattern, the first adder primitive (root_block) is mandatory to
 *                          form the pattern, but every adder primitive after that is optional as the case
 *                          when forming a short adder chain.
 *      is_chain          : does this pack pattern go across clusters. For example, carry chains can normally cross
 *                          between logic blocks.
 *      chain_root_pins   : this is only non-empty for pack_patterns with is_chain set. It points to a specific
 *                          pin of the root_block primitive (Ex. cin of an adder primitive) that is directly
 *                          connected to a cluster-level block pin that can be drive from the preceding cluster.
 *                          If the cluster has more than one chain of this pack pattern type this vector will
 *                          have a pointer to each primitive pin that can represent a starting point for this chain.
