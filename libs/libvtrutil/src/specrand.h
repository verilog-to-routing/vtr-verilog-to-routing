/*
 * For inclusion in the SPEC cpu benchmarks
 * This file implements the random number generation necessary for the SPEC cpu benchmarks. The functions
 * defined here are used in vtr_random.h/cpp
 *
 *
 * A C-program for MT19937, with initialization improved 2002/1/26.
 * Coded by Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto.
 *
 * Before using, initialize the state by using init_genrand(seed)  
 * or init_by_array(init_key, key_length).
