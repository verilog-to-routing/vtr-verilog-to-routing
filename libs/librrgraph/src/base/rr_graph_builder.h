     *   - DEGREE_BFS: Order by degree primarily, and BFS traversal order secondarily.
     *   - RANDOM_SHUFFLE: Shuffle using the specified seed. Great for testing.

     * It might be worth further research, as the DEGREE_BFS algorithm is simple and
     * makes some arbitrary choices, such as the starting node.
     * The re-ordering algorithm (DEGREE_BFS) does not speed up the router on most architectures
     * vs. using the node ordering created by the rr-graph builder in VPR, so it is off by default.
     * The other use of this algorithm is for some unit tests; by changing the order of the nodes
     * in the rr-graph before routing we check that no code depends on the rr-graph node order
     * Nonetheless, it does improve performance ~7% for the SymbiFlow Xilinx Artix 7 graph.
