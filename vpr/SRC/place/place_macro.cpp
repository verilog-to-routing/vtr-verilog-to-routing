    This file contains functions related to placement macros. The term "placement macros"
  refers to a structure that contains information on blocks that need special treatment
  during placement and possibly routing. 
  
    An example of placement macros is a carry chain. Blocks in a carry chain have to be 
  placed in a specific orientation or relative placement so that the carry_in's and the 
  carry_out's are properly aligned. With that, the carry chains would be able to use the 
  direct connections specified in the arch file. Direct connections with the pin's 
  fc_value 0 would be treated specially in routing where the whole carry chain would be
  treated as a unit and regular routing would not be used to connect the carry_in's and 
  carry_out's. Floorplanning constraints may also be an example of placement macros.

    The function alloc_and_load_placement_macros allocates and loads the placement 
  macros in the following steps:
  (1) First, go through all the block types and mark down the pins that could possibly 
      be part of a placement macros. 
  (2) Then, go through the netlist of all the pins marked in (1) to find out all the 
      heads of the placement macros using criteria depending on the type of placement 
	  macros. For carry chains, the heads of the placement macros are blocks with 
	  carry_in's not connected to any nets (OPEN) while the carry_out's connected to the 
	  netlist with only 1 SINK.
  (3) Traverse from the heads to the tails of the placement macros and load the 
      information in the t_pl_macro data structure. Similar to (2), tails are identified 
	  with criteria depending on the type of placement macros. For carry chains, the 
	  tails are blocks with carry_out's not connected to any nets (OPEN) while the 
	  carry_in's is connected to the netlist which has only 1 SINK.

    The only placement macros supported at the moment are the carry chains with limited
  functionality. 
    
	Current support for placement macros are:
  (1) The arch parser for direct connections is working. The specifications of the direct
      connections are specified in sample_adder_arch.xml and also in the 
	  VPR_User_Manual.doc
  (2) The placement macros allocator and loader is working.
  (3) The initial placement of placement macros that respects the restrictions of the 
      placement macros is working.
  (4) The post-placement legality check for placement macros is working.
    
	Current limitations on placement macros are:
  (1) One block could only be a part of a carry chain. In the future, if a block is part
      of multiple placement macros, we should load 1 huge placement macro instead of 
	  multiple placement macros that contain the same block.
  (2) Bus direct connections (direct connections with multiple bits) are supported. 
      However, a 2-bit carry chain when loaded would become 2 1-bit carry chains.
	  And because of (1), only 1 1-bit carry chain would be loaded. In the future, 
	  placement macros with multiple-bit connections or multiple 1-bit connections 
	  should be allowed.
  (3) Placement macros that span longer or wider than the chip would cause an error. 
      In the future, we *might* expand the size of the chip to accommodate such 
	  placement macros that are crucial.

    In order for the carry chain support to work, two changes are required in the 
  arch file. 
  (1) For carry chain support, added in a new child in <layout> called <directlist>. 
      <directlist> specifies a list of available direct connections on the FPGA chip 
	  that are necessary for direct carry chain connections. These direct connections 
	  would be treated specially in routing if the fc_value for the pins is specified 
	  as 0. Note that only direct connections that has fc_value 0 could be used as a 
	  carry chain.
    
      A <directlist> may have 0 or more children called <direct>. For each <direct>, 
	  there are the following fields:
        1) name:  This specifies the name given to this particular direct connection.
        2) from_pin:  This specifies the SOURCEs for this direct connection. The format 
		              could be as following:
                       a) type_name.port_name, for all the pins in this port.
                       b) type_name.port_name [end_pin_index:start_pin_index], for a 
					      single pin, the end_pin_index and start_pin_index could be 
						  the same.
        3) to_pin:  This specifies the SINKs for this direct connection. The format is 
		            the same as from_pin. 
                    Note that the width of the from_pin and to_pin has to match.
        4) x_offset: This specifies the x direction that this connection is going from 
		             SOURCEs to SINKs.
        5) y_offset: This specifies the y direction that this connection is going from 
		             SOURCEs to SINKs. 
                     Note that the x_offset and y_offset could not both be 0.
        6) z_offset: This specifies the z sublocations that all the blocks in this 
		             direct connection to be at.
    
      The example of a direct connection specification below shows a possible carry chain 
	  connection going north on the FPGA chip:
       _______________________________________________________________________________
      | <directlist>                                                                  |
      |   <direct name="adder_carry" from_pin="adder.cout" to_pin="adder.cin"         |
	  |           x_offset="0" y_offset="1" z_offset="0"/>                            |
      | </directlist>                                                                 |
      |_______________________________________________________________________________|
	  A corresponding arch file that has this direct connection is sample_adder_arch.xml
      A corresponding blif file that uses this direct connection is adder.blif

  (2) As mentioned in (1), carry chain connections using the directs would only be 
      recognized if the pin's fc_value is 0. In order to achieve this, pin-based fc_value
	  is required. Hence, the new <fc> tag replaces both <fc_in> and <fc_out> tags.
	  
	  A <fc> tag may have 0 or more children called <pin>. For each <fc>, there are the 
	  following fields:
	    1) default_in_type: This specifies the default fc_type for input pins. They could
		                    be "frac", "abs" or "full".
		2) default_in_val: This specifies the default fc_value for input pins.
		3) default_out_type: This specifies the default fc_type for output pins. They could
		                     be "frac", "abs" or "full".
		4) default_out_val: This specifies the default fc_value for output pins.

	  As for the <pin> children, there are the following fields:
	    1) name: This specifies the name of the port/pin that the fc_type and fc_value 
		         apply to. The name have to be in the format "port_name" or 
				 "port_name [end_pin_index:start_pin_index]" where port_name is the name
				 of the port it apply to while end_pin_index and start_pin_index could
				 be specified to apply the fc_type and fc_value that follows to part of
				 a bus (multi-pin) port.
	    2) fc_type: This specifies the fc_type that would be applied to the specified pins.
		3) fc_val: This specifies the fc_value that would be applied to the specified pins.

	  The example of a pin-based fc_value specification below shows that the fc_values for
	  the cout and the cin ports are 0:
	   _______________________________________________________________________________
      | <fc default_in_type="frac" default_in_val="0.15" default_out_type="frac"      |
	  |     default_out_val="0.15">                                                   |
      |    <pin name="cin" fc_type="frac" fc_val="0"/>                                |
      |    <pin name="cout" fc_type="frac" fc_val="0"/>                               |
      | </fc>                                                                         |
	  |_______________________________________________________________________________|

      A corresponding blif file that uses this direct connection is adder.blif
