are working in the VTR framework, enter make in the parent directory to build 
all tools used in the framework (including VPR).

# How to use VPR

Run "./vpr" by itself for a more comprehensive list of options that can be used with VPR.

Read the VPR User Manual for detailed information on how to use VPR and what the
