/**
 * @file
 * @brief This file declares the TurnModelRouting class, which abstract all
 * Turn Model routing algorithms. Classes implementing specific Turn Model
 * algorithms are expected to inherit from this class and comply with its
 * interface.
 *
 * Overview
 * ========
 * The TurnModelRouting class abstracts Turn Model routing algorithms.
 * The route_flow() method implemented in this class, routes a traffic flow
 * by adding a NoC link at a time to form a route between two NoC routers.
 * The destination router of the last added NoC link is called the current
 * NoC router.
 * The main idea in Turn Model algorithm is to forbid specific turns
 * for traffic flows to avoid deadlock. If at least one clockwise turn
 * and one anticlockwise turn are forbidden, no cyclic dependency can
 * happen, making deadlock impossible. Turn model algorithms forbid
 * specific turns based on the source, destination, and current NoC
 * router locations in a mesh or torus topology. TurnModelRouting class
 * exposes a shared interface for all Turn Model routing algorithms.
 * Derived classes can implement specific routing algorithms by implementing
 * their override of the exposed interface. More specifically,
 * the get_legal_directions() method returns legal directions that a
 * traffic flow can follow based on where the source, destination, and current
 * NoC routers are located. select_next_direction() selects one of these
 * legal directions. The TurnModelRouting() class does not implement these
 * methods, but calls them in route_flow(). For example, XYRouting can be
 * implemented by overriding these two methods. get_legal_directions()
 * should return horizontal directions when the current router and the
 * destination are not in the same column. When the traffic flow arrives
 * a router located in the same column as the destination,
 * get_legal_directions() should return vertical directions.
 * select_next_direction() selects one of two available directions to get
 * closer to the destination.
 *
 * When the routing algorithm presents two possible direction choices
 * at a router, we use a biased coin flip to randomly select one of them.
 * This random decision is biased towards choosing the direction in which
 * the distance to the destination is longer. For example, if the last router
 * added to a partial route is located at (3, 5) while the route is destined
 * for (7, 7), the random decision favors the X-direction twice as much as
 * the Y-direction. This approach distributes the chance of selecting
 * a shortest path more evenly among all possible paths between two
 * NoC routers.
 *
 * TurnModelRouting also provides multiple helper methods that can be used
 * by derived classes.
