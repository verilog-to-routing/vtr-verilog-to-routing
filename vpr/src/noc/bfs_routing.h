/**
 * @file 
 * @brief This file defines the BFSRouting class.
 * 
 * Overview
 * ========
 * The BFSRouting class performs packet routing between physical routers in the
 * FPGA. This class is based on the BFS algorithm.
 * 
 * The BFS algorithm is used to explore the NoC from the starting router in the
 * traffic flow. Once the destination router is found a path from the source to
 * the destination router is generated. The main advantage of this algorithm is
 * that the found path from the source to the destination router uses the 
 * minimum number of links required within the NoC. This algorithm does not
 * guarantee deadlock freedom. In other words, the algorithm might generate
 * routes that form cycles in channel dependency graph.
