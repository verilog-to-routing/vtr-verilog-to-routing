/**
 * @file
 * @brief This file declares the WestFirstRouting class, which implements
 * the west-first routing algorithm.
 *
 * Overview
 * ========
 * The WestFirstRouting class performs packet routing between routers in the
 * NoC using west-first routing algorithm. In this algorithm, moving towards
 * west has a higher priority than other directions. When the traffic flow
 * moves in directions other than west, it is no longer allowed to move
 * in towards west.
