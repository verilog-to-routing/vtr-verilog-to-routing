/**
 * @file
 * @brief This file declares the ChannelDependencyGraph class.
 *
 * Overview
 * ========
 * The NoC routing algorithm might generate routes that cause a deadlock.
 * The Channel Dependency Graph (CDG) is formed by associating a node with each
 * link in the NoC topology. For each traffic flow route, we consider the
 * consecutive links traversed to reach the destination. For each consecutively
 * traversed link pair (Li, Lj) in the given topology, we add an directed edge from
 * Vi to Vj, where Vi and Vj are nodes in CDG that are associated with Li and Lj.
 * Absence of cycles in the formed CDG guarantees deadlock freedom.
 *
 * To learn more about channel dependency graph, refer to the following papers:
 * 1) Glass, C. J., & Ni, L. M. (1992). The turn model for adaptive routing.
 * ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News, 20(2), 278-287.

 * interconnection networks. IEEE Transactions on computers, 100(5), 547-553.
