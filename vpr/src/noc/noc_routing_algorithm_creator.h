/**
 * @file
 * @brief  This file defines the NocRoutingAlgorithmCreator class, which creates
 * the routing algorithm that will be used to route packets within the NoC.
 * 
 * Overview
 * ========
 * There are a number of different available NoC routing algorithms.
 * This class is a factory object for the NocRouting abstract class.
 * This class constructs the appropriate routing algorithm based on
 * the user specification in the command line. The user identifies a
 * specific routing algorithm in the command line by providing a string
 * (which is the name of routing algorithm).
 * Then the corresponding routing algorithm is created here based on the 
 * provided string.
