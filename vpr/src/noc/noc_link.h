/*
 * @file
 * @brief This file defines the NocLink class.
 *
 * Overview
 * ========
 * The NocLink represents a connection between two routers in the NoC.
 * The NocLink acts as edges in the NoC and can be used to traverse between routers.The
 * NocLinks are created based on the user provided topology information in the arch file.
 * The NocLink contains the following information:
 *
 * - The source router and destination router the link connects
 * - The bandwidth usage of the link. When a link is used within a
 * traffic flow (communication between two routers),
 * each link in the communication path needs to
 * support a predefined bandwidth of the flow. Every time a link
 * is used in a flow, its bandwidth usage increases based on the
 * bandwidth needed by this link. This is useful to track as it
 * can indicate when a link is being overused (the bandwidth usage
 * exceeds the links supported capability).
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 *  ----------                       ----------
 *  /        /        link           /        /
 *  / router / --------------------->/ router /
 *  /   a    /                       /   b    /
 *  /        /                       /        /
 *  /--------/                       /--------/
 * 
 * In the example above the links source router would be router a and
 * the sink router would be router b.
