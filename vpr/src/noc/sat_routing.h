/**
 * @file
 * @brief SAT formulation of NoC traffic flow routing.
 *
 * This file implements a SAT formulation of NoC routing problem.
 * Each (traffic flow, link) pair is associated with boolean variable.
 * When one of these boolean variables are set by the SAT solver, it means
 * that the corresponding traffic flow is routed through the corresponding link.
 * To ensure that traffic flow routes are continuous, deadlock-free, with
 * minimum link congestion, several constraints are added to the SAT formulation.
 *
 * For more details refer to the following paper:
 * The Road Less Traveled: Congestion-Aware NoC Placement and Packet Routing for FPGAs
