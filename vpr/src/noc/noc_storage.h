/**
 * @file
 * @brief This file defines the NocStorage class.
 * 
 * Overview
 * ======== 
 * The NocStorage class represents the model of the embedded NoC
 * in the FPGA device. The model describes the topology of the NoC,
 * its placement on the FPGA and properties of the NoC components. 
 * The NocStorage consists of two main
 * components, which are routers and links. The routers and
 * links can be accessed to retrieve information about them
 * using unique identifier (NocRouterId, NocLinkId). Each router
 * and link modelled in the NoC has a unique ID.
 * 
 * Router
 * ------
 * A router is component of the NoC and is defined by the
 * NocRouter class. Routers are represent physical FPGA tiles
 * and represent entry and exit points to and from the NoC. 
 * 
 * Link
 * ----
 * A link is a component of the NoC and is defined by the
 * NocLink class. Links are connections between two routers.
 * Links are used by routers to communicate with other routers
 * in the NoC. They can be thought of as edges in a graph. Links
 * have a source router where they exit from and sink router where
 * they enter. It is important to note that the links are not
 * bi-directional; the legal way to traverse a link is from the
 * source router of the link to the sink router.
