/**
 * @file
 * @brief This file declares the NorthLastRouting class, which implements
 * the north-last routing algorithm.
 *
 * Overview
 * ========
 * The NorthLastRouting class performs packet routing between routers in the
 * NoC using north-last routing algorithm. In this algorithm, once the north
 * direction is taken, no other direction can be taken. In other words,
 * a traffic flow is no longer allowed to turn when it started moving
 * towards the north. North-last algorithm generated deadlock free routes
 * in a mesh or torus topology.
