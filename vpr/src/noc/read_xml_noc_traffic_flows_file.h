/**
 *  @brief The purpose of this file is to read and parse an xml file that has 
 *         a '.flows' extension. This file contains the description of
 *         a number of traffic flows within the NoC. A traffic flow describes
 *         the communication between two routers in the NoC.
 * 
 *         All the processed traffic flows are stored inside the 
 *         NocTrafficFlows class for future use.
 * 
 *         'read_xml_noc_traffic_flows_file' is the main function that performs 
 *         all the tasks listed above and should be used externally to process
 *         the traffic flows file. This file also contains a number of internal
 *         helper functions that assist in parsing the traffic flows file.
