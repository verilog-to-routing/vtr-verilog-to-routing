/**
 * @file 
 * @brief This file defines the NocTrafficFlows class, which contains all
 * communication between routers in the NoC.
 * 
 * Overview
 * ======== 
 * The NocTrafficFlows class contains all traffic flows in a given 
 * design. A traffic flow is defined by the t_noc_traffic_flow struct.
 * Each traffic flow is indexed by a unique id that can be used to
 * retrieve information about them.  
 * 
 * The class also associates traffic flows to their logical source routers 
 * (start point) and logical sink routers (end point). This is useful if one wants to find traffic flows based on just the source or sink logical router.
 * The routes for the traffic flows are expected to change throughout placement
 * as routers will be moved within the chip. Therefore this class provides
 * a datastructure to keep track of which flows have been updated (re-routed).
 * 
 * Finally, this class also stores all router blocks (logical routers) in the 
 * design.
 * 
 * This class will be primarily used during 
 * placement to identify which routers inside the NoC(NocStorage) need to be
 * routed to each other.This is important since the router modules can be moved
 * around to different tiles on the FPGA device.
