/**
 * @file
 * @brief This file declares the NegativeFirstRouting class, which implements
 * the negative-first routing algorithm.
 *
 * Overview
 * ========
 * The NegativeFirstRouting class performs packet routing between routers in the
 * NoC using negative-first routing algorithm. In this algorithm, moving towards
 * negative directions (west and south) has a higher priority. Once the traffic flow
 * moves towards north or east, it is no longer allowed to take a turn that aligns
 * the route towards south and west.
