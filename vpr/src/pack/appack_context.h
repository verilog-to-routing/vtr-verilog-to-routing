    // consider? Any candidate beyond this distance will not be proposed.
    // This is set in the constructor.

    //       so we can specify the max distance per block type!

    // =========== Unrelated clustering ==================================== //
    // After searching for candidates by connectivity and timing, the user may
    // turn on unrelated clustering, which will allow molecules which are
    // unrelated to the cluster being created to be attempted to be packed in.
    // APPack uses flat placement information to decide which unrelated
    // molecules to try.

    // APPack will search for unrelated molecules in the tile which contains
    // the flat location of the cluster. It will then look farther out, tile
    // by tile. This parameter is the maximum distance from the cluster's tile
    // that APPack will search. Setting this to 0 would only allow APPack to
    // search within the cluster's tile. Setting this to a higher number would
    // allow APPack to search farther away; but may bring in molecules which
    // do not "want" to be in the cluster.
    static constexpr float max_unrelated_tile_distance = 5.0f;

    // Unrelated clustering occurs after all other candidate selection methods
    // have failed. This parameter sets how many time we will attempt unrelated
    // clustering between failures of unrelated clustering. If this is set to
    // 1, and unrelated clustering failed for a cluster, it will not be attempted
    // again for that cluster (note: if it succeeds, the number of attempts get
    // reset).
    // NOTE: A similar option exists in the candidate selector class. This was
    //       duplicated since it is very likely that APPack would need a
    //       different value for this option than the non-APPack flow.
    static constexpr int max_unrelated_clustering_attempts = 10;
