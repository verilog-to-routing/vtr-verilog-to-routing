/**
 * @brief A clusterer that generates clusters by greedily choosing the clusters
 *        which appear to have the best gain for a given neighbor.
 *
 * This clusterer generates one cluster at a time by finding candidate molecules
 * and selecting the molecule with the highest gain.
 *
 * The clusterer takes an Atom Netlist which has be pre-packed into pack
 * patterns (e.g. carry chains) as input and produces a set of legal clusters
 * of these pack molecules as output. Legality here means that it was able to
 * find a valid intra-lb route for the inputs of the clusters, through the
 * internal molecules, and to the outputs of the clusters.

     * @brief Constructor of the Greedy Clusterer class.
     *
     * The clusterer may be invoked many times during the packing flow. This
     * constructor will pre-compute information before clustering which can
     * improve the performance of the clusterer.
     *
     *  @param packer_opts
     *              Options passed by the user to configure the packing and
     *              clustering algorithms.
     *  @param analysis_opts
     *              Options passed by the user to configure timing analysis in
     *              the clusterer.
     *  @param atom_netlist
     *              The atom netlist to cluster over.
     *  @param arch
     *              The architecture to cluster over.
     *  @param high_fanout_thresholds
     *              The thresholds for what to consider as a high-fanout net
     *              for each logical block type. The clusterer will not consider
     *              nets with fanout higher than this to be important in
     *              candidate block selection (gain computation).
     *              A reason for it being per block type is that some blocks,
     *              like RAMs, have weak gains to other RAM primitives due to
     *              fairly high fanout address nets, so a higher fanout
     *              threshold for them is useful in generating a more dense
     *              packing.
     *  @param is_clock
     *              The set of clock nets in the Atom Netlist.
     *  @param is_global
     *              The set of global nets in the Atom Netlist. These will be
     *              routed on special dedicated networks, and hence are less
     *              relavent to locality / attraction.
     *  @param pre_cluster_timing_manager
     *              Timing manager class which holds the timing information of
     *              the primitive netlist. Used by the seed selector to select
     *              critical seeds and the candidate selector to select
     *              timing critical candidates.
     *  @param appack_ctx
     *              The APPack state. This contains the options used to
     *              configure APPack and the flat placement.

     *              (due to pack patterns, e.g. carry chains).
     *  @param allow_unrelated_clustering
     *              Allows primitives which have no attraction to the given
     *              cluster to be packed into it. This can lead to a denser
     *              packing, but tends to be bad for wirelength and timing.

     *              When true, tries to create clusters that balance the logical
     *              block type utilization. This is useful when some primitives
     *              have multiple logical block types to which they can cluster,
     *              e.g. multiple sizes of physical RAMs exist on the chip.
     *  @param attraction_groups
     *              These are groups of primitives that have extra attraction to
     *              each other; currently they are used to guide the clusterer
     *              when it must cluster some parts of a design densely due to
     *              user placement/floorplanning constraints. They are created
     *              if some floorplan regions are overfilled after a clustering
     *              attempt.
     *  @param mutable_device_ctx
     *              The mutable device context. The clusterer will modify the
     *              device context by potentially increasing the size of the
     *              device to fit the clustering.
     *
     *  @return num_used_type_instances
     *              The number of used logical blocks of each type by the
     *              clustering. This information may be useful when detecting
     *              if the clustering can fit on the device.
