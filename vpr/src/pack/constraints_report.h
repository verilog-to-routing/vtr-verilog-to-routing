/**
 * @brief Check if any constraint partition regions are overfull,
 * i.e. the partition contains more clusters of a certain type
 * than it has room for. If the region is overfull, a message is
 * printed saying which partition is overfull, and by how many clusters.
 *
 * To reduce the complexity of this function, several assumptions are made.
 * 1) Regions of a partition do not overlap, meaning that the capacity of each
 * partition for accommodating blocks of a specific type can be calculated by
 * accumulating the capacity of its regions.
 * 2) Partitions do not overlap. This means that each physical tile is in at most
 * one partition.
 *
 * VPR can still work if these assumptions do not hold true, but for tight overlapping
 * partitions, the placement engine may fail to find a legal placement.
 *
 * Adds the overfilled partition regions to the overfull_partition_regions vector.
 *
 * @return True if there is at least one overfull partition.
