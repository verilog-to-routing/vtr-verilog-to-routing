/**
 * @brief Verify the flat placement for use in the packer.
 *
 * This method will check the following invariants:
 *  1. Every atom has a defined x and y position.
 *  2. Every atom has non-negative placement information values.
 *  3. Every molecule has atoms that have the same placement information.
 *
 * This method will log error messages for each issue it finds and will return
 * a count of the number of errors.
 *
 *  @param flat_placement_info
 *              The flat placement to verify.
 *  @param atom_netlist
 *              The netlist of atoms in the circuits.
 *  @param prepacker
 *              The prepacker object used to prepack the atoms into molecules.
