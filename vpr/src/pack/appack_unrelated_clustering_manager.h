/**
 * @brief Manager class for unrelated clustering in APPack.
 *
 * After searching for candidates by connectivity and timing, the user may
 * turn on unrelated clustering, which attempt to pack into the cluster molecules
 * which are not attracted to the molecules within the current cluster (according
 * to the standard packing heuristics). APPack uses flat placement information
 * to decide which unrelated molecules to try.
 *
 * APPack will search for unrelated molecules in the tile which contains
 * the flat location of the cluster.  It will then look farther out, tile
 * by tile. The distance that it will search up to is the max unrelated tile
 * distance.
 *
 * Unrelated clustering occurs after all other candidate selection methods
 * have failed. This attempts to cluster in molecules that are not attracted
 * (using the packer's heuristics) to the molecules within a given cluster.
 * The max unrelated clustering attempts sets how many times we will attempt unrelated
 * clustering between failures of unrelated clustering. If a molecule used
 * for unrelated clustering failed to cluster it will not be attempted
 * again for that cluster (note: if it succeeds, the number of attempts get
 * reset).
 * NOTE: A similar option exists in the candidate selector class. This was
 *       duplicated since it is very likely that APPack would need a
 *       different value for this option than the non-APPack flow.
