/**
 * @brief Verify the clustering of the atom netlist.
 *
 * This verifier is independent to how the clustering was performed and checks
 * invariants that all clusterings must adhere to in order to be used in the
 * rest of the VPR flow. The assumption is that if a clustering passes this
 * verifier it can be passed into placement without issue.
 *
 * By design, this verifier uses no global variables and tries to recompute
 * anything that it does not assume.
 *
 * Invariants (are checked by this function):
 *  - All atoms are in clusters.
 *  - The atom lookup is consistent with the clb_atoms.
 *  - The pbs of the atoms are consistent with the clusters.
 *  - The floorplanning constraints on the clusters are consistent with the
 *    floorplanning constraints on the atoms within each cluster.
 *
 * Assumptions (are not checked by this function):
 *  - The atom netlist is valid (matches the input design).
 *  - The user placement constraints are valid (match what was passed by the
 *    user).
 *
 *  @param clb_nlist            The clustered netlist to verify.
 *  @param atom_nlist           The atom netlist used to generate the
 *                              clustering.
 *  @param atom_lookup          A lookup between the atoms and the clusters they
 *                              are in.
 *  @param clb_atoms            The atoms in each cluster.
 *  @param cluster_constraints  Floorplanning constraints on each cluster.
 *  @param constraints          Floorplanning constraints on each atom.
 *
 *  @return The number of errors found in the clustering. Will also print error
 *          log messages for each error found.
