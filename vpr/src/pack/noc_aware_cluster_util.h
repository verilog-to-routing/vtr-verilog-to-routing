/**
 * @file This file includes helper functions used to find NoC groups
 * in the atom netlist and assign NoC group IDs to atom blocks.
 *
 * A NoC group is a set of atom blocks that are reachable from a NoC router
 * through low fanout nets. During packing, atom blocks that belong to two different
 * NoC group IDs cannot be packed with each other into the same clustered block.
 * This prevents atom blocks that belong to two separate NoC-attached modules from
 * being packed with each other, and helps with more localized placement of NoC-attached
 * modules around their corresponding NoC routers.
 *
 * For more details refer to the following paper:
 * The Road Less Traveled: Congestion-Aware NoC Placement and Packet Routing for FPGAs
