 *          flow.
 *
 * This methods were orginally part of methods found in the place.cpp file and
 * the place_constraints.cpp files. Moved into here to put it all in one place.
 * Since these methods should be completely independent of the place flow, it
 * makes sense that they are in their own file.

/**
 * @brief Verify the placement of the clustered blocks on the device.
 *
 * This is verifier is independent to how the placement was performed and check
 * invariants that all placements must adhere to in order to be used in the
 * rest of the VPR flow. The assumption is that if a placement passes this
 * verifier it can be passed into routing without issue.
 *
 * By design, this verifier uses no global variables and tries to recompute
 * anything that it does not assume.
 *
 * Invariants (are checked by this function):
 *  - All clusters are placed.
 *  - All clusters are placed in a tile, sub-tile that it can exist in.
 *  - The cluster locations are consistent with the clusters in each block.
 *  - The placement macros are consistent such that all blocks are in the
 *    proper relative positions.
 *  - All clusters are placed in legal positions according to the floorplanning
 *    constraints.
 *
 * Assumptions (are not checked by this function):
 *  - The clustered netlist is valid.
 *  - The device grid is valid.
 *  - The cluster constraints are valid.
 *  - The macros are valid.
 *
 *  @param blk_loc_registry     A registry containing the current placement of
 *                              the clusters.
 *  @param place_macros         The place macros for the clustered netlist.
 *  @param clb_nlist            The clustered netlist being verified.
 *  @param device_grid          The device grid being verified over.
 *  @param cluster_constraints  The constrained regions that each cluster is
 *                              constrained to.
 *
 *  @return The number of errors found in the placement. Will also print error
 *          log messages for each error found.
