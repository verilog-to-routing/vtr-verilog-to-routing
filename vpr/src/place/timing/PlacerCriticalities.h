/**
 * @brief PlacerCriticalities returns the clustered netlist connection criticalities
 *        used by the placer ('sharpened' by a criticality exponent).
 *
 * Usage
 * =====
 * This class also serves to map atom netlist level criticalites (i.e. on AtomPinIds)
 * to the clustered netlist (i.e. ClusterPinIds) used during placement.
 *
 * Criticalities are updated by update_criticalities(), given that `update_enabled` is
 * set to true. It will update criticalities based on the atom netlist connection
 * criticalities provided by the passed in SetupTimingInfo.
 *
 * This process can be done incrementally, based on the modified connections/AtomPinIds
 * returned by SetupTimingInfo. However, the set returned only reflects the connections
 * changed by the last call to the timing info update (update_setup() method of SetupTimingInfo).
 *
 * Therefore, if SetupTimingInfo is updated twice in a row without criticalities
 * getting updated after the first update of SetupTimingInfo (PlacerCriticalities::update_enabled = false),
 * the returned set of modified connections/AtomPinIds by SetupTimingInfo after its second update does not
 * account for all the connections that have been modified.
 * To address this issue, whenever update_criticalities() is called with flag update_enabled = false,
 * we don't update criticalities and set flag recompute_required to true to remember that criticalities
 * need to be recomputed from scratch in the first call to update_criticalities() with update_enabled = true.
 *
 * This class also maps/transforms the modified atom connections/pins returned by the
 * timing info into modified clustered netlist connections/pins after calling
 * update_criticalities(). The interface then enables users to iterate over this range
 * via pins_with_modified_criticalities(). This is useful for incrementally re-calculating
 * the timing costs.
 *
 * The criticalities of individual connections can then be queried by calling the
 * criticality() member function.
 *
 * Implementation
 * ==============
 * To support incremental re-calculation, the class saves the last criticality exponent
 * passed to PlacerCriticalities::update_criticalites(). If the next update uses the same
 * exponent, criticalities can be incrementally updated. Otherwise, they must be re-calculated
 * from scratch, since a change in exponent changes *all* criticalities.
 *
 * Calculating criticalities:
 * All the raw setup slack values across a single clock domain are gathered
 * and rated from the best to the worst in terms of criticalities. In order
 * to calculate criticalities, all the slack values need to be non-negative.
 * Hence, if the worst slack is negative, all the slack values are shifted
 * by the value of the worst slack so that the value is at least 0. If the
 * worst slack is positive, then no shift happens.
 *
 * The best (shifted) slack (the most positive one) will have a criticality of 0.
 * The worst (shifted) slack value will have a criticality of 1.
 *
 * Criticalities are used to calculated timing costs for each connection.
 * The formula is cost = delay * criticality.
 *
 * For a more detailed description on how criticalities are calculated, see
 * calc_relaxed_criticality() in `timing_util.cpp`.
