/**
 * @brief PlacerSetupSlacks returns the RAW setup slacks of clustered netlist connection.
 *
 * Usage
 * =====
 * This class mirrors PlacerCriticalities by both its methods and its members. The only
 * difference is that this class deals with RAW setup slacks returned by SetupTimingInfo
 * rather than criticalities. See the documentation on PlacerCriticalities for more.
 *
 * RAW setup slacks are unlike criticalities. Their values are not confined between
 * 0 and 1. Their values can be either positive or negative.
 *
 * This class also provides iterating over the clustered netlist connections/pins that
 * have modified setup slacks by the last call to update_setup_slacks(). However, this
 * utility is mainly used for incrementally committing the setup slack values into the
 * structure `connection_setup_slack` used by many placer routines.
