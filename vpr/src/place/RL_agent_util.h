 *
 * @param placer_state Move generators store a reference to the placer context to avoid global state access.
 * @param placer_opts Contains information about the placement algorithm and its parameters.
 * @param move_lim represents the num of moves per temp.
 * @param noc_attraction_weight The attraction weight by which the NoC-biased centroid move adjust the computed location
 * towards reachable NoC routers from the moving block.
 * @param rng A reference to a random number generator to be used by move generators.
 *
 * @return Two unique pointers referring to move generators. These move generators are supposed to be used
 * in the first and second states of the agent.
