 * @brief Find all the nets and pins affected by this swap and update costs.

 * Find all the nets affected by this swap and update the bounding box (wiring)
 * costs. This cost function doesn't depend on the timing info.
 *
 * Find all the connections affected by this swap and update the timing cost.
 * For a connection to be affected, it not only needs to be on or driven by
 * a block, but it also needs to have its delay changed. Otherwise, it will
 * not be added to the affected_pins structure.
 *
 * For more, see update_td_delta_costs().
 *
 * The timing costs are calculated by getting the new connection delays,
 * multiplied by the connection criticalities returned by the timing
 * analyzer. These timing costs are stored in the proposed_* data structures.
 *
 * The change in the bounding box cost is stored in `bb_delta_c`.
 * The change in the timing cost is stored in `timing_delta_c`.
 * ts_nets_to_update is also extended with the latest net.
