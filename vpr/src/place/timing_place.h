 *
 *   @class PlacerSetupSlacks
 *              Queries connection **RAW** setup slacks, which can
 *              range from negative to positive values. Also maps
 *              atom pin setup slacks to clb pin setup slacks.
 *   @class PlacerCriticalities
 *              Query connection criticalities, which are calculuated
 *              based on the raw setup slacks and ranges from 0 to 1.
 *              Also maps atom pin crit. to clb pin crit.
 *   @class PlacerTimingCosts
 *              Hierarchical structure used by update_td_costs() to
 *              maintain the order of addition operation of float values
 *              (to avoid round-offs) while doing incremental updates.
 *
 * Calculating criticalities:
 *      All the raw setup slack values across a single clock domain are gathered
 *      and rated from the best to the worst in terms of criticalities. In order
 *      to calculate criticalities, all the slack values need to be non-negative.
 *      Hence, if the worst slack is negative, all the slack values are shifted
 *      by the value of the worst slack so that the value is at least 0. If the
 *      worst slack is positive, then no shift happens.
 *
 *      The best (shifted) slack (the most positive one) will have a criticality of 0.
 *      The worst (shifted) slack value will have a criticality of 1.
 *
 *      Criticalities are used to calculated timing costs for each connection.
 *      The formula is cost = delay * criticality.
 *
 *      For a more detailed description on how criticalities are calculated, see
 *      calc_relaxed_criticality() in `timing_util.cpp`.

/**
 * @brief PlacerCriticalities returns the clustered netlist connection criticalities
 *        used by the placer ('sharpened' by a criticality exponent).
 *
 * Usage
 * =====
 * This class also serves to map atom netlist level criticalites (i.e. on AtomPinIds)
 * to the clustered netlist (i.e. ClusterPinIds) used during placement.
 *
 * Criticalities are updated by update_criticalities(), given that `update_enabled` is
 * set to true. It will update criticalities based on the atom netlist connection
 * criticalities provided by the passed in SetupTimingInfo.
 *
 * This process can be done incrementally, based on the modified connections/AtomPinIds
 * returned by SetupTimingInfo. However, the set returned only reflects the connections
 * changed by the last call to the timing info update.
 *
 * Therefore, if SetupTimingInfo is updated twice in succession without criticalities
 * getting updated (update_enabled = false), the returned set cannot account for all
 * the connections that have been modified. In this case, we flag `recompute_required`
 * as false, and we recompute the criticalities for every connection to ensure that
 * they are all up to date. Hence, each time update_setup_slacks_and_criticalities()
 * is called, we assign `recompute_required` the opposite value of `update_enabled`.
 *
 * This class also maps/transforms the modified atom connections/pins returned by the
 * timing info into modified clustered netlist connections/pins after calling
 * update_criticalities(). The interface then enables users to iterate over this range
 * via pins_with_modified_criticalities(). This is useful for incrementally re-calculating
 * the timing costs.
 *
 * The criticalities of individual connections can then be queried by calling the
 * criticality() member function.
 *
 * Implementation
 * ==============
 * To support incremental re-calculation, the class saves the last criticality exponent
 * passed to PlacerCriticalities::update_criticalites(). If the next update uses the same
 * exponent, criticalities can be incrementally updated. Otherwise, they must be re-calculated
 * from scratch, since a change in exponent changes *all* criticalities.

/**
 * @brief PlacerTimingCosts mimics a 2D array of connection timing costs running from:

 *
 *      PlacerTimingCosts connection_timing_costs(cluster_ctx.clb_nlist); //Construct
 *
 *      //...
 *
 *      //Modify a connection cost
 *      connection_timing_costs[net_id][ipin] = new_cost;
 *
 *      //Potentially other modifications...
 *
 *      //Calculate the updated timing cost, of all connections,
 *      //incrementally based on modifications
 *      float total_timing_cost = connection_timing_costs.total_cost();
 *
 * However behind the scenes PlacerTimingCosts tracks when connection costs are modified,
 * and efficiently re-calculates the total timing cost incrementally based on the connections
 * which have had their cost modified.
 *
 * Implementation
 * ==============
 * Internally, PlacerTimingCosts stores all connection costs in a flat array in the last part
 * of connection_costs_.  To mimic 2d-array like access PlacerTimingCosts also uses two proxy
 * classes which allow indexing in the net and pin dimensions (NetProxy and ConnectionProxy
 * respectively).
 *
 * The first part of connection_costs_ stores intermediate sums of the connection costs for
 * efficient incremental re-calculation. More concretely, connection_costs_ stores a binary
 * tree, where leaves correspond to individual connection costs and intermediate nodes the
 * partial sums of the connection costs. (The binary tree is stored implicitly in the
 * connection_costs_  vector, using Eytzinger's/BFS layout.) By summing the entire binary
 * tree we calculate the total timing cost over all connections.
 *
 * Using a binary tree allows us to efficiently re-calculate the timing costs when only a subset
 * of connections are changed. This is done by 'invalidating' intermediate nodes (from leaves up
 * to the root) which have ancestors (leaves) with modified connection costs. When the
 * total_cost() method is called, it recursively walks the binary tree to re-calculate the cost.
 * Only invalidated nodes are traversed, with valid nodes just returning their previously
 * calculated (and unchanged) value.
 *
 * For a circuit with 'K' connections, of which 'k' have changed (typically k << K), this can
 * be done in O(k log K) time.
 *
 * It is important to note that due to limited floating point precision, floating point
 * arithmetic has an order dependence (due to round-off). Using a binary tree to total
 * the timing connection costs allows us to incrementally update the total timing cost while
 * maintianing the *same order of operations* as if it was re-computed from scratch. This
 * ensures we *always* get consistent results regardless of what/when connections are changed.
 *
 * Proxy Classes
 * =============
 * NetProxy is returned by PlacerTimingCost's operator[], and stores a pointer to the start of
 * internal storage of that net's connection costs.
 *
 * ConnectionProxy is returned by NetProxy's operator[], and holds a reference to a particular
 * element of the internal storage pertaining to a specific connection's cost. ConnectionProxy
 * supports assignment, allowing clients to modify the connection cost. It also detects if the
 * assigned value differs from the previous value and if so, calls PlacerTimingCosts's
 * invalidate() method on that connection cost.
 *
 * PlacerTimingCosts's invalidate() method marks the cost element's ancestors as invalid (NaN)
 * so they will be re-calculated by PlacerTimingCosts' total_cost() method.
