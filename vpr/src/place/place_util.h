 * @brief Data structure that stores different cost values in the placer.
 *
 * Although we do cost calculations with float values, we use doubles
 * for the accumulated costs to avoid round-off, particularly on large
 * designs where the magnitude of a single move's delta cost is small
 * compared to the overall cost.
 *
 * To balance the trade-off between timing and wirelength (bb) cost, the
 * change in costs produced by block swaps are divided by the final cost
 * values of the previous iteration. However, the divisions are expensive,
 * so we store their multiplicative inverses when they are updated in
 * the outer loop routines to speed up the normalization process.
 *
 *   @param cost The weighted average of the wiring cost and the timing cost.
 *   @param bb_cost The bounding box cost, aka the wiring cost.
 *   @param timing_cost The timing cost, which is connection delay * criticality.
 *
 *   @param bb_cost_norm The normalization factor for the wiring cost.
 *   @param timing_cost_norm The normalization factor for the timing cost, which
 *              is upper-bounded by the value of MAX_INV_TIMING_COST.
 *
 *   @param noc_cost_terms NoC-related cost terms
 *   @param noc_cost_norm_factors Normalization factors for NoC-related cost terms.
 *
 *   @param MAX_INV_TIMING_COST Stops inverse timing cost from going to infinity
 *              with very lax timing constraints, which avoids multiplying by a
 *              gigantic timing_cost_norm when auto-normalizing. The exact value
 *              of this cost has relatively little impact, but should be large
 *              enough to not affect the timing costs computation for normal
 *              constraints.
 *
