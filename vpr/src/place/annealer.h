/**
 * @class PlacementAnnealer
 * @brief Simulated annealing optimizer for minimizing placement cost via block swaps.
 *
 * @details This class implements simulated annealing to optimize placement cost by swapping clustered blocks.
 * Swaps that reduce the cost are always accepted, while those that increase the cost are accepted
 * with a diminishing probability.
 *
 * The annealing process consists of two nested loops:
 * - The **inner loop** (implemented in `placement_inner_loop()`) performs individual swaps, all evaluated at a fixed temperature.
 * - The **outer loop** adjusts the temperature and determines whether further iterations are needed.
 *
 * Usage workflow:
 * 1. Call `outer_loop_update_timing_info()` to update timing information.
 * 2. Execute `placement_inner_loop()` for swap evaluations.
 * 3. Call `outer_loop_update_state()` to check if more outer loop iterations are needed.
 * 4. Optionally, use `start_quench()` to set the temperature to zero for a greedy optimization (quenching stage),
 *    then repeat steps 1 and 2.
 *
 *    Usage example:
 *    **************************************
 *    PlacementAnnealer annealer(...);
 *
 *    do {
 *      annealer.outer_loop_update_timing_info();
 *      annealer.placement_inner_loop();
 *    } while (annealer.outer_loop_update_state());
 *
 *    annealer.start_quench();
 *    annealer.outer_loop_update_timing_info();
 *    annealer.placement_inner_loop();
 *    **************************************
