     * @brief The matrix to store the minimum delay between different points on different layers.
     *
     *The matrix used to store delay information is a 5D matrix. This data structure stores the minimum delay for each tile type on each layer to other layers
     *for each dx and dy. We decided to separate the delay for each physical type on each die to accommodate cases where the connectivity of a physical type differs
     *on each layer. Additionally, instead of using d_layer, we distinguish between the destination layer to handle scenarios where connectivity between layers
     *is not uniform. For example, if the number of inter-layer connections between layer 1 and 2 differs from the number of connections between layer 0 and 1.
     *One might argue that this variability could also occur for dx and dy. However, we are operating under the assumption that the FPGA fabric architecture is regular.
