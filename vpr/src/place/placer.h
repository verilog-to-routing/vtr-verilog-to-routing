/**
 * @file placer.h
 * @brief Declares the Placer class, which encapsulates the functionality, data structures,
 * and algorithms required for the (annealing-based) placement stage
 *
 * The Placer class initializes necessary objects, performs an initial placement,
 * and runs simulated annealing optimization. This optimization minimizes
 * wirelength (bounding box) and timing costs to achieve an efficient placement solution.
 *
 * Key features of the Placer class:
 * - Encapsulates all placement-related variables, cost functions, and data structures.
 * - Supports optional NoC (Network-on-Chip) cost optimizations if enabled.
 * - Interfaces with timing analysis, placement delay calculation.
 * - Provides a mechanism for checkpointing the placement state.
 * - Includes debugging and validation utilities to verify the correctness of placement.
