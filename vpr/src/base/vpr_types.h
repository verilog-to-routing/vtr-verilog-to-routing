/* This is a core file that defines the major data types used by VPR

 This file is divided into generally 4 major sections:

 1.  Global data types and constants
 2.  Packing specific data types
 3.  Placement specific data types
 4.  Routing specific data types

 Key background file:

 An understanding of libarchfpga/physical_types.h is crucial to understanding this file.  physical_types.h contains information about the architecture described in the architecture description language

 Key data structures:
 t_rr_node - The basic building block of the interconnect in the FPGA architecture

 Cluster-specific main data structure:
 t_pb: Stores the mapping between the user netlist and the logic blocks on the FPGA architecture.  For example, if a user design has 10 clusters of 5 LUTs each, you will have 10 t_pb instances of type cluster and within each of those clusters another 5 t_pb instances of type LUT.
 The t_pb hierarchy follows what is described by t_pb_graph_node
