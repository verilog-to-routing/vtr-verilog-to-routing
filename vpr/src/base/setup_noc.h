/**
 * @file 
 * @brief This is the setup_noc header file. The main purpose of 
 * this file is to create a model of the NoC within FPGA using
 * the description provided by the user in the architecture
 * description file. The NoC can only be created here and modifying the
 * NoC elsewhere will cause an error after calling setup_noc().
 * 
 * Overview
 * ========
 * To create a NoC model, the setup_noc() function defined below
 * should be used. It performs the following steps:
 * 
 * Router Creation
 * ---------------
 * Each router described in the archietcture file is created and
 * added to the NoC. Since the routers represents physical tiles on
 * the FPGA, when the router is created, it is also assigned to a
 * corresponding physical router tile. 
 * 
 * Link Creation
 * -------------
 * The user describes a "connection list", which rerpesents an intended
 * connection between two routers in the NoC. Each link connects two
 * routers together. For each router, a number
 * of Links are created to connect it to another router in its "connection
 * list".
