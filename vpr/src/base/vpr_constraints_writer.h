/**
 * @file
 * @brief This file contains functions related to writing out a vpr constraints XML file.
 *
 * Overview
 * ========
 * VPR floorplan constraints consist of region constraints specified for primitives that must be respected during packing and placement.
 * The constraints XML file is printed using the XML schema vpr/src/base/vpr_constraints.xsd
 *
 * Routines related to writing out the file are in vpr/src/base/vpr_constraints_serializer.h. For more information on how
 * the writing interface works, refer to vpr/src/route/SCHEMA_GENERATOR.md
 *
 * The option --write_vpr_constraints can be used to generate the constraints files.
 *
 * The routines in this file are currently used to generate floorplan constraints for testing purposes.
 * The constraints files they generate are used to determine whether VPR is correctly adhering to
 * floorplan constraints during its packing and placement stages.
 *
 * The placer options --floorplan_num_horizontal_partitions (int) and --floorplan_num_vertical_partitions (int) can be used
 * to specify how many partitions should be created in the test constraints file.
 * For example, if both options are 2, the constraints file will split the grid into quadrants, dividing the blocks between
 * four partitions - two partitions in the horizontal dimension, and two partitions in the vertical dimension.
