/**
 * @file
 * @brief This file defines the VprConstraints class used to store and read out data related to user-specified
 * 		  block and region constraints for the packing and placement stages.
 *
 * Overview
 * ========
 * This class contains functions that read in and store information from a constraints XML file.
 * The XML file provides a partition list, with the names of the partitions, and each atom in the partition.
 * It also specifies which regions the partitions should be placed in. Atoms cannot be placed in more than one partition.
 * If an atom is assigned to more than one partition, the last partition is was assigned to will be the partition it is placed in.
 *
 * Related Classes
 * ===============
 * The following definitions are useful to understanding this class:
 *
 * Partition: a grouping of atoms that are constrained to a portion of an FPGA
 * See vpr/src/base/partition.h for more detail
 *
 * Region: the x and y bounds of a rectangular region, optionally including a subtile value,
 * that atoms in a partition are constrained to
 * See vpr/src/base/region.h for more detail
 *
 * PartitionRegion: the union of regions that a partition can be placed in
 * See vpr/src/base/partition_region.h for more detail
 *
