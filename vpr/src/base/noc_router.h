/*
 * @file
 * @brief This file defines the NocRouter class.
 *
 * Overview
 * ========
 * The NocRouter represents a physical router in the NoC.
 * The NocRouter acts as nodes in the NoC and is used as
 * entry points to the NoC. The NocRouters are created based
 * on the topology information provided by the user in the arch file.
 *
 * The NocRouter contains the following information:
 * - The router id. This represents the unique ID given by the
 * user in the architecture description file when describing a
 * router. The purpose of this is to help the user identify the
 * router when logging information or displaying errors.
 * - The grid position of the physical router tile this object
 * represents. Each router in the NoC represents a physical router
 * tile in the FPGA device. By storing the grid positions, we can quickly
 * get the corresponding physical router tile information by searching
 * the DeviceGrid in the device context.
 * - The design module (router cluster blocks) currently occupying this tile. Within the user
 * design there will be a number of instantiations of NoC routers. The user
 * will also provide information about which router blocks will be
 * communication with each other. During placement, it is possible for
 * the router blocks to move between the physical router tiles, so
 * by storing the module reference, we can determine which physical router tiles are communicating between each other and find a route
 * between them.
