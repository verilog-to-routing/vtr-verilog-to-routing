/**
 * @brief This object encapsulates VPR's state.
 *
 * There is typically a single instance which is
 * accessed via the global variable g_vpr_ctx (see globals.h/.cpp).
 *
 * It is divided up into separate sub-contexts of logically related data structures.
 *
 * Each sub-context can be accessed via member functions which return a reference to the sub-context:
 *  - The default the member function (e.g. device()) return an const (immutable) reference providing
 *    read-only access to the context. This should be the preferred form, as the compiler will detect
 *     unintentional state changes.
 *  - The 'mutable' member function (e.g. mutable_device()) will return a non-const (mutable) reference
 *    allowing modification of the context. This should only be used on an as-needed basis.
 *
 * Typical usage in VPR would be to call the appropriate accessor to get a reference to the context of
 * interest, and then operate on it.
 *
 *
 * For example if we were performing an action which required access to the current placement, we would do:
 *
 * ```
 *    void my_analysis_algorithm() {
 *        //Get read-only access to the placement
 *        auto& place_ctx = g_vpr_ctx.placement();
 *
 *        //Do something that depends on (but does not change)
 *        //the current placement...
 *
 *    }
 * ```
 * <!-- NOTE: Markdown ``` are used to display the code properly in the documentation -->
 *
 * If we needed to modify the placement (e.g. we were implementing another placement algorithm) we would do:
 *
 * ```
 *    void my_placement_algorithm() {
 *        //Get read-write access to the placement
 *        auto& place_ctx = g_vpr_ctx.mutable_placement();
 *
 *        //Do something that modifies the placement
 *        //...
 *    }
 * ```
 *
 *
 * @note The returned contexts are not copyable, so they must be taken by reference.
