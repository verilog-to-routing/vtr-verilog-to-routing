 *
 * The partial placement object stores the placement of the APNetlist blocks
 * during different stages of the Analytical Placement flow. The Partial
 * Placement need not represent a legal placement; however, the placed blocks
 * will always be on the device and will respect fixed block locations.

/**
 * @brief A partial placement during the Analytical Placement flow
 *
 * The goal of this class is to contain positional information about the blocks
 * that gets passed around during analytical placement.
 *
 * The placement of a given APBlock is given by the following values:
 *  - x_loc         The x-position of the APBlock on the device grid
 *  - y_loc         The y-position of the APBlock on the device grid
 *  - layer_num     The layer on the device grid this block is on
 *  - sub_tile      The sub-tile this APBlock wants to be a part of
 * TODO: Not sure if we want to keep the sub tile, but it may be useful for
 *       transferring information from the PartialLegalizer to the FullLegalizer.
 *
 * x_loc, y_loc, and layer_num are represented by doubles since APBlocks can be
 * placed in continuous space, rather than constrained to the integer device
 * grid of legal locations. These are doubles rather than floats since they
 * better fit the matrix solver we currently use.
 *
 * layer_num is represented by an int since it is not decided by an analytical
 * solver, but rather by the legalizers; so it does not need to be in continuous
 * space.
 *
 * This object assumes that the APNetlist object is static during the operation
 * of Analytical Placement (no blocks are added or removed).
 *
 * Note: The placement information was stored in this object as a struct of
 *       arrays instead of an array of structs since it is assumed that the
 *       main operations being performed on this placement will be analytical;
 *       thus the x positions and y positions will likely be stored and computed
 *       as separate continuous vectors.
