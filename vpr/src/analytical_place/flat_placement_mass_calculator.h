/**
 * @brief A calculator class which computes the M-dimensional mass of AP blocks
 *        and the capacity of tiles.
 *
 * Each atom in the Atom Netlist represents some model which may be implemented
 * on the FPGA. The FPGA architecture has M models. Since an AP block may
 * represent multiple atoms, its "mass" (the amount of "space" this block takes
 * up) must be M-dimensional. For example, a LUT+FF molecule would have a mass
 * of <1, 1> if LUTs and FFs were the only models in the architecture; while a
 * single LUT would have a mass of <1, 0>.
 *
 * This class handles how the mass of the AP blocks are calculated.
 *
 * This class also handles how much capacity each tile in the FGPA has. This
 * capacity is an approximation of how much M-dimensional mass that the tile
 * can hold. Since tiles may have multiple modes, the actual capacity of the
 * tiles change depending on what is in the tile. This class simplifies this
 * to assume that the capacity does not change and approximates the theoretical
 * mass that the tile should aim to hold.
