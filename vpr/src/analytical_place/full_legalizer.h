 * @brief APPack: A flat-placement-informed Packer Placer.

 * AP Flow to guide the Packer and Placer to a better solution.
 *
 * In the Packer, the flat-placement can provide more context for the clusters
 * to pull in atoms that want to be near the other atoms in the cluster, and
 * repell atoms that are far apart. This can potentially make better clusters
 * than a Packer that does not know that information.
 *
 * In the Placer, the flat-placement can help decide where clusters of atoms
 * want to be placed. If this placement is then fed into a Simulated Annealing
 * based Detailed Placement step, this would enable it to converge on a better
 * answer faster.
