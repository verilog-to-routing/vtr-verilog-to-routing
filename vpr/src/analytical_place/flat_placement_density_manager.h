/**
 * @brief Manager class for computing the density of a flat placement.
 *
 * Density is a function of mass and volume. Since a flat placement is a
 * continuous placement of discrete objects, the space the objects are placed
 * over needs to be partitioned into discrete bins. Regions that are too dense
 * are called overfilled bins and regions that may hold more (not too dense)
 * are called underfilled bins. This class manages the construction of these
 * bins and how overfilled / underfilled they are.
 *
 * Currently, a bin is created for each tile in the FPGA grid (with a unique
 * root tile location). For example, a CLB taking up a single tile would be a
 * 1x1 bin, while a DSP block taking up multiple tiles may be a 4x1 bin. The
 * capacity of each bin is the capacity of the tile it represents (as computed
 * by the flat placement mass calculator). When AP blocks are added / removed
 * from bins, this class will maintain the current utilization of the bin. Since
 * these masses / capacities are repesented by M-dimensional quantities (where
 * M is the number of models in the architecture), the overfill and underfill of
 * each bin is given as an M-dimensional vector. For example, in an architecture
 * of only LUTs and FFs, an overfill of <3, 1> means that a bin has 3 too many
 * LUTs and 1 too many FFs.
 *
 * This class is able to answer questions about the current density of the flat
 * placement such as which bins are currently overfilled, what bin is at the
 * given location, etc.
 *
 * TODO: Add an option to this class to change the granularity of the bins. This
 *       may allow us to trade off quality and runtime.
