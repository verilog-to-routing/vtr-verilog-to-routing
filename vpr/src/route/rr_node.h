/* Main structure describing one routing resource node.  Everything in       *
 * this structure should describe the graph -- information needed only       *
 * to store algorithm-specific data should be stored in one of the           *
 * parallel rr_node_* structures.                                            *
 *                                                                           *
 * xlow, xhigh, ylow, yhigh:  Integer coordinates (see route.c for           *
 *       coordinate system) of the ends of this routing resource.            *
 *       xlow = xhigh and ylow = yhigh for pins or for segments of           *
 *       length 1.  These values are used to decide whether or not this      *
 *       node should be added to the expansion heap, based on things         *
 *       like whether it's outside the net bounding box or is moving         *
 *       further away from the target, etc.                                  *
 * type:  What is this routing resource?                                     *
 * ptc_num:  Pin, track or class number, depending on rr_node type.          *
 *           Needed to properly draw.                                        *
 * cost_index: An integer index into the table of routing resource indexed   *
 *             data t_rr_index_data (this indirection allows quick dynamic   *
 *             changes of rr base costs, and some memory storage savings for *
 *             fields that have only a few distinct values).                 *
 * capacity:   Capacity of this node (number of routes that can use it).     *
 * num_edges:  Number of edges exiting this node.  That is, the number       *
 *             of nodes to which it connects.                                *
 * edges[0..num_edges-1]:  Array of indices of the neighbours of this        *
 *                         node.                                             *
 * switches[0..num_edges-1]:  Array of switch indexes for each of the        *
 *                            edges leaving this node.                       *
 *                                                                           *
 * direction: if the node represents a track, this field                     *
 *            indicates the direction of the track. Otherwise                *
 *            the value contained in the field should be                     *
 *            ignored.                                                       *
 * side: The side of a grid location where an IPIN or OPIN is located.       *
 *       This field is valid only for IPINs and OPINs and should be ignored  *
 *       otherwise.                                                          */
