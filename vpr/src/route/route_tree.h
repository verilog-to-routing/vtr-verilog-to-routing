/**
 * @file
 * @brief This file defines the RouteTree and RouteTreeNode, used to keep partial or full routing
 * state and timing information for a net.
 *
 * Overview
 * ========
 * A RouteTree holds a root RouteTreeNode and exposes top level operations on the tree, such as
 * RouteTree::update_from_heap() and RouteTree::prune().
 *
 * Routing itself is not done using this representation. The route tree is pushed to the heap with
 * ConnectionRouterInterface::timing_driven_route_connection_from_route_tree() and the newly found path
 * is committed via RouteTree::update_from_heap(). The timing data is updated with RouteTree::reload_timing() where required.
 *
 * Each net in the netlist given to the router has a single RouteTree, which is kept in RoutingContext::route_trees.
 *
 * Usage
 * =====
 *
 * A RouteTree either requires a RRNodeId or a ParentNetId (as the source node) to construct:
 *
 *      RouteTree tree(inet);
 *      // ...
 *
 * RouteTrees cannot be manually updated. The only way to extend them is to first route a connection and then update from the resulting heap.
 *
 *      std::tie(found_path, cheapest) = router.timing_driven_route_connection_from_route_tree(tree.root(), ...);
 *      if (found_path)
 *           std::tie(std::ignore, rt_node_of_sink) = tree.update_from_heap(&cheapest, ...);
 *
 * Congested paths in a tree can be pruned using RouteTree::prune(). This is done between iterations to keep only the legally routed section.
 * Note that updates to a tree require an update to the global occupancy state via pathfinder_update_cost_from_route_tree().
 * RouteTree::prune() depends on this global data to find congestions, so the flow to prune a tree is somewhat convoluted:
 *
 *      RouteTree tree2 = tree;
 *      // Prune the copy (using congestion data before subtraction)
 *      vtr::optional<RouteTree&> pruned_tree2 = tree2.prune(connections_inf);
 *
 *      // Subtract congestion using the non-pruned original
 *      pathfinder_update_cost_from_route_tree(tree.root(), -1);
 *
 *      if (pruned_tree2) {  // Partially pruned
 *          // Add back congestion for the pruned route tree
 *          pathfinder_update_cost_from_route_tree(pruned_tree2.value().root(), 1);
 *          ...
 *      } else {  // Fully destroyed
 *          ...
 *
 * Most usage of RouteTree outside of the router requires iterating through existing routing. Both RouteTree and RouteTreeNode exposes functions to
 * traverse the tree.
 *
 * To iterate over all nodes in the tree:
 *
 *      RouteTree& tree = route_ctx.route_trees[inet].value();
 *
 *      for (auto& node: tree.all_nodes()) {
 *          // ...
 *      }
 *
 * This will walk the tree in depth-first order. Breadth-first traversal would require recursion:
 *
 *      const RouteTreeNode& root = tree.root();
 *
 *      for (auto& child: root.child_nodes()) {
 *          // recurse...
 *      }
 *
 * To walk a node's subtree in depth-first order:
 *
 *      for (auto& node: root.all_nodes()) {  // doesn't include root!
 *          // ...   
 *      }
 *
 * RouteTree::find_by_rr_id() finds the RouteTreeNode for a given RRNodeId. Note that RRNodeId isn't a unique
 * key for SINK nodes and therefore an external lookup (generated from sink nodes returned by RouteTree::update_from_heap())
 * or a search may be required to find a certain SINK.
 *
 * When the occupancy and timing data is up to date, a tree can be sanity checked using RouteTree::is_valid().
