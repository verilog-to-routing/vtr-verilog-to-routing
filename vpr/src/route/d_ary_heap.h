/**
 * @brief Min-heap with D child nodes per parent.
 *
 * @note
 * Currently, DAryHeap only has two children, BinaryHeap and FourAryHeap. On small circuits,
 * these heaps have negligible differences in runtime, but on larger heaps, runtime is lower when
 * using FourAryHeap. On Koios large benchmarks, the runtime is ~5% better on FourAryHeap compared
 * to BinaryHeap. This is likely because FourAryHeap has lower tree height, and as we can fit 8
 * heap node (each is 8 bytes) on a cache line (commonly 64 bytes on modern architectures), each
 * heap operation (the comparison among sibling nodes) tends to benefit from the caches.
