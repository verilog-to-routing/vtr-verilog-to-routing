/**
 * @brief Global routines related to displaying RR node overuse info.
 *
 * This file contains all the routines that print out the information on overused RR nodes
 * and congested nets. The main purpose of these routines is to aid the debugging process
 * should the VPR fail to implement the circuit. Functionalities that resolve these circuit
 * issues should NOT be included here or in overuse_report.cpp
 *
 * An RR node is overused when the number of nets passing through it exceed the node's
 * routing net capacity. A successfully routed circuit is void of these overused nodes.
 *
 * All the nets passing through an overused RR node are flagged as congested nets.
