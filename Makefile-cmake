#This is a simple wrapper hiding cmake from non-expert end users.
#
# It supports the targets:
#   'make' 		 	 - builds everything (all libaries/executables)
#   'make clean' 	 - removes generated build objects/libraries/executables etc.
# 	'make distclean' - will clean everything including the cmake generated build files
#
# All other targets (e.g. 'make vpr') are passed to the cmake generated makefile
# and processed according to the CMakeLists.txt.
#
# To perform a debug build use:
#   'make BUILD_TYPE=debug'

#Default build type
# Possible values:
#    release
#    debug
BUILD_TYPE = release

#Suppress makefile output (e.g. entering/leaving directories)
