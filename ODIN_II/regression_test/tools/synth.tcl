# Yosys performs various optimizations on memories in the design. Then, it detects DFFs at
# memory read ports and merges them into the memory port. I.e. it consumes an asynchronous
# memory port and the flip-flops at its interface and yields a synchronous memory port.
# Afterwards, Yosys detects cases where an asynchronous read port is only connected via a mux
# tree to a write port with the same address. When such a connection is found, it is replaced
# with a new condition on an enable signal, allowing for removal of the read port. Finally
# Yosys merges share-able memory ports into single memory ports and collects memories, their
# port and create multiport memory cells.
