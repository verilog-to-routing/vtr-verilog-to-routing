<!--
Regression test placement constraint file. The purpose of this file
is to verify that we are able to constrain atoms to different logical
block types (even though the atoms can implement either one).

This was implemented to fix an issue where the packer was implementing
atoms into a logical block type that could not feasibly be placed in
the partition region.
