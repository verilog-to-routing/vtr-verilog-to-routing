  Flagship Heterogeneous Architecture with Carry Chains for VTR 7.0.

  - 40 nm technology
  - General purpose logic block: 
    K = 6, N = 10, fracturable 6 LUTs (can operate as one 6-LUT or two 5-LUTs with all 5 inputs shared) 
    with optionally registered outputs

    Height = 4, found on every (8n+6)th column
  - Routing architecture: L = 4, fc_in = 0.15, Fc_out = 0.1

  Details on Modelling:

  The electrical design of the architecture described here is NOT from an 
  optimized, SPICED architecture.  Instead, we attempt to create a reasonable 
  architecture file by using an existing commercial FPGA to approximate the area, 
  delay, and power of the underlying components. This is combined with a reasonable 40 nm 
  model of wiring and circuit design for low-level routing components, where available.
  The resulting architecture has delays that roughly match a commercial 40 nm FPGA, but also 
  has wiring electrical parameters that allow the wire lengths and switch patterns to be 
  modified and you will still get reasonable delay results for the new architecture.
  The following describes, in detail, how we obtained the various electrical values for this 
  architecture.

  Rmin for nmos and pmos, routing buffer sizes, and I/O pad delays are from the ifar 
  architecture created by Ian Kuon: K06 N10 45nm fc 0.15 area-delay optimized architecture. 
  (n10k06l04.fc15.area1delay1.cmos45nm.bptm.cmos45nm.xml)      
  This routing architecture was optimized for 45 nm, and we have scaled it linearly to 40 nm to 
  match the overall target (a 40 nm FPGA).

  We obtain delay numbers by measuring delays of routing, soft logic blocks, 
  memories, and multipliers from test circuits on a Stratix IV GX device 
  (EP4SGX230DF29C2X, i.e. fastest speed grade). For routing, we took the average delay of H4 and V4 
  wires.  Rmetal and Cmetal values for the routing wires were obtained from work done by Charles 
  Chiasson. We use a 96 nm half-pitch (corresponding to mid-level metal stack 40 nm routing) and 
  take the R and C data from the ITRS roadmap.  

  For the general purpose logic block, we assume that the area and delays of the Stratix IV 
  crossbar is close enough to the crossbar modelled here.  
  Stratix IV uses 52 inputs and 20 feedback lines, but only a half-populated crossbar, leading to 
  36:1 multiplexers.  We match these parameters in this architecture.

  For LUTs, we include LUT 
  delays measured from Stratix IV which is dependant on the input used (ie. some 
  LUT inputs are faster than others).  The CAD tools at the time of VTR 7 does 
  not consider differences in LUT input delays.

  Adder delays obtained as approximate values from a Stratix IV EP4SE230F29C3 device.  
  Delay obtained by compiling a 256 bit adder (registered inputs and outputs, 
  all pins except clock virtual) then measuring the delays in chip-planner, 
  sumout delay = 0.271ns to 0.348 ns, intra-block carry delay = 0.011 ns, 
  inter-block carry delay = 0.327 ns.  Given this data, I will approximate 
  sumout 0.3 ns, intra-block carry-delay = 0.01 ns, and 
  inter-block carry-delay = 0.16 ns (since Altera inter-block carry delay has 
  overhead that we don't have, I'll approximate the delay of a simpler chain at 
  one half what they have.  This is very rough, anything from 0.01ns to 0.327ns 
  can be justified).

  Logic block area numbers obtained by scaling overall tile area of a 65nm 
  Stratix III device, (as given in Wong, Betz and Rose, FPGA 2011) to 40 nm, then subtracting out 
  routing area at a channel width of 300. We use a channel width of 300 because it can route 
  all the VTR 6.0 benchmark circuits with an approximately 20% safety margin, and is also close to the
  total channel width of Stratix IV. Hence this channel width is close to the commercial practice of
  choosing a width that provides high routability. The architecture can be routed at different channel
  widths, but we estimate the tile size and hence the physical length of routing wires assuming
  a channel width of 300.

  Sanity checks employed:
    1.  We confirmed the routing buffer delay is ~1/3rd of total routing delay at L = 4. This matches 
        common electrical design.

			  <!-- VB & JL: Using Ian Kuon's transistor sizing and drive strength data for routing, at 40 nm. Ian used BPTM 
			     models. We are modifying the delay values however, to include metal C and R, which allows more architecture
			     experimentation. We are also modifying the relative resistance of PMOS to be 1.8x that of NMOS
			     (vs. Ian's 3x) as 1.8x lines up with Jeff G's data from a 45 nm process (and is more typical of 
			     45 nm in general). I'm upping the Rmin_nmos from Ian's just over 6k to nearly 9k, and dropping 
			     RminW_pmos from 18k to 16k to hit this 1.8x ratio, while keeping the delays of buffers approximately
			     lined up with Stratix IV. 
			     We are using Jeff G.'s capacitance data for 45 nm (in tech/ptm_45nm).

	                     by 2.5x when looking up in Jeff's tables.
			     The delay values are lined up with Stratix IV, which has an architecture similar to this

      <!-- VB: the mux_trans_size and buf_size data below is in minimum width transistor *areas*, assuming the purple
           book area formula. This means the mux transistors are about 5x minimum drive strength.
           We assume the first stage of the buffer is 3x min drive strength to be reasonable given the large 
           mux transistors, and this gives a reasonable stage ratio of a bit over 5x to the second stage. We assume
           the n and p transistors in the first stage are equal-sized to lower the buffer trip point, since it's fed
           by a pass transistor mux. We can then reverse engineer the buffer second stage to hit the specified 
           buf_size (really buffer area) - 16.2x minimum drive nmos and 1.8*16.2 = 29.2x minimum drive.
           I then took the data from Jeff G.'s PTM modeling of 45 nm to get the Cin (gate of first stage) and Cout 
           (diff of second stage) listed below.  Jeff's models are in tech/ptm_45nm, and are in min feature multiples.

           2.5x when looking up in Jeff's tables.
           Finally, we choose a switch delay (58 ps) that leads to length 4 wires having a delay equal to that of SIV of 126 ps.
           This also leads to the switch being 46% of the total wire delay, which is reasonable. -->

       <!-- Define general purpose logic block (CLB) ends -->

    <!-- Define fracturable multiplier begin -->
    <!-- This multiplier can operate as a 36x36 multiplier that can fracture to two 18x18 multipliers each of which can further fracture to two 9x9 multipliers 
	   For delay modelling, the 36x36 DSP multiplier in Stratix IV has a delay of 1.523 ns + 1.93 ns
	    = 3.45 ns. The 18x18 mode doesn't need to sum four 18x18 multipliers, so it is a bit
	   faster: 1.523 ns for the multiplier, and 1.09 ns for the multiplier output block.
	    For the input and output interconnect delays, unlike Stratix IV, we don't
	   have any routing/logic flexibility (crossbars) at the inputs.  There is some output muxing
	   in Stratix IV and this architecture to select which multiplier outputs should go out (e.g.
	   9x9 outputs, 18x18 or 36x36) so those are very close between the two architectures. 
	   We take the conservative (slightly pessimistic)
           approach modelling the input as the same as the Stratix IV input delay and the output delay the same as the Stratix IV DSP out delay.
		   
	   We estimate block area by using the published Stratix III data (which is architecturally identical to Stratix IV)
	      (H. Wong, V. Betz and J. Rose, "Comparing FPGA vs. Custom CMOS and the Impact on Processor Microarchitecture", FPGA 2011) of 0.2623 
		  mm^2 and scaling from 65 to 40 nm to obtain 0.0993 mm^2. That area is for a DSP block with approximately 2x the functionality of 
		  the block we use (can implement two 36x36 multiplies instead of our 1, eight 18x18 multiplies instead of our 4, etc.). Hence we 
		  divide the area by 2 to obtain 0.0497 mm^2. One minimum-width transistor units = 60 L^2 (where L = 40 nm), so is 518,000 MWTUS. 
		  That area includes routing and the connection block input muxes.  Our DSP block is four 
		  rows high, and hence includes four horizontal routing channel segments and four vertical ones, which is 4x the routing of a logic 
		  block (single tile). It also includes 3.6x the outputs of a logic block, and 1.8x the inputs. Hence a slight overestimate of the routing
		  area associated with our DSP block is four times that of a logic tile, where the routing area of a logic tile was calculated above (at W = 300)
		  as 30481 MWTAs. Hence the (core, non-routing) area our DSP block is approximately 518,000 - 4 * 30,481 = 396,000 MWTUs.

           Area and delay based off Stratix IV 9K and 144K memories (delay from linear interpolation, Tsu(483 ps, 636 ps) Tco(1084ps, 1969ps)).  
           Input delay = 204ps (from Stratix IV LAB line) - 72ps (this architecture does not lump connection box delay in internal delay)
           Output delay = M9K buffer 50ps
		   
		   Area is obtained by appropriately scaling and adjusting the published Stratix III (which is architecturally identical to Stratix IV)
		   data from H. Wong, V. Betz and J. Rose, "Comparing FPGA vs. Custom CMOS and the Impact on Processor Microarchitecture", FPGA 2011.
		   Linearly interpolating (by bit count) between the M9k and M144k areas to obtain an M32k (our RAM size) point yields a 65 nm area of
		   of 0.153 mm^2. Interpolating based on port count between the RAMs would instead yield an area of 0.209 mm^2 for our 32 kB RAM; since 
		   bit count accounts for more area than ports for a RAM this size we choose the bit count interpolation; however, since the port interpolation
		   is not radically different this also gives us confidence that interpolating based on bits is OK, but slightly underpredicts area.
		   Scaling to 40 nm^2 yields .0579 mm^2, and converting to MWTUs at 60 L^2 / MWTU yields 604,000 MWTUs. This includes routing. A Stratix IV
		   M9K RAM is one row high and hence has one routing tile (one horizonal and one vertical routing segment area). An M144k RAM has 8 such tiles.
		   Linearly interpolating on
		   bits to 32 kb yields 2.2 routing tiles incorporated in the area number above. The inter-block routing represents 30% of the area of a logic 
		   tile according to D. Lewis et al, "Architectural Enhancements in Stratix V," FPGA 2013. Hence we should subtract 0.3 * 2.2 * 84,375 MWTUs to
		   obtain a RAM core area (not including inter-block routing) of 548,000 MWTU areas for our 32 kb RAM in a 40 nm process.
