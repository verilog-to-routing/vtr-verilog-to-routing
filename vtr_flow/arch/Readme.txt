# Architecture Files
###################################################

This directory contains sample architecture files.

The vast majority of users will want to use our flagship architecture
file found here:

    timing/k6_frac_N10_frac_chain_mem32K_40nm.xml

This architecture file describes a modern-style architecture somewhat
aligned to a commercial 40nm Stratix IV FPGA. Our flagship architecture
contains fracturable 6-LUTs, configurable 32Kb memories, fracturable
36x36 multipliers and carry chains. Details about delay, area, and power
modelling are found in the comments within that file.

For those interested in other architectures, we have organized our
architectures into three categories: non-timing-driven architectures,
power-only architectures, and timing-driven architectures.

# Timing-driven architectures

We have included several variations of our flagship architecture.
The most important one being an architecture with carry chain support
(k6_frac_N10_frac_chain_mem32K_40nm.xml).  This architecture file serves
as a proof-of-concept on how carry chains may be used in our CAD flow.

We have included a few simple architecture files and an architecture file
with embedded floating-point-cores to demonstrate how one can specify
a large range of different architecture files using our framework.
The delay models used here are somewhat reasonable but not as well vetted
as our flagship architecture.

# Power-only architectures

These architecture files serve as examples on how to specify power models
in VTR.

# Non-timing-driven architectures

These architecture files serve as examples on how to specify a range
of different fracturable LUT and configurable memory architectures.
The intention is to provide more examples of the specification language.
As these architecture files do not have delay models, we don't recommend
drawing conclusions from them.

# Architectures with an Embedded Network on Chip (NoC)

These architecture files include examples on how to describe the topology 
of an embedded NoC within the FPGA device. These example architecture
files can be found under the "noc" subdirectory.
