#Peak memory
#We set a 100MiB minimum threshold since the memory 
#alloctor (e.g. TBB vs glibc) can cause a difference
#particularly on small benchmarks
#
#Note that due to different binary search path, peak memory
#can differ significantly during binary search (e.g. a larger
#or smaller channel width explored during the search can
#significantly affect the size of the RR graph, and correspondingly
#peak mememory usage in VPR. As a result we just a larger permissible
#range for peak memory usage.
