/*
*   The purpose of this file is to support netlists that
*   contain new types of hard blocks. Specifically, user defined
*   hard blocks are identified within the netlist and then instantiated
*   so that they are later written to the generated .blif file.
*
*   For example, consider a user design that contains a new hard block
*   called "router". This hard block is embedded within the FPGA architecture
*   but the Quartus synthesis tool has no reference to what a "router" block is.
*   Since the tool has no information to the hard block, the generated netlist
*   does not properly model the hard blocks. Instead of declaring a single hard 
*   block in the netlist, it was found that the generated .vqm netlist
*   from Quartus inserted a LUT for every input port of the hard block
*   and then a LUT & DFF for every output port of the hard block.
*   An example is shown below:
*
*   Suppose we had the following module in the design (representing a hard
*   block):
*
*       router router_1 (
*            .input_one  (pin_1), 
*            .input_two  (pin_2),
*            .output_one (pin_3),
*            .output_two (pin_4),
*        );
*
*   In the generated netlist from Quartus, the model will be represented as:
*       
*                                   router_1
*       --------------------------------------------------------------------
*       |            LUT                                                   |

*
*       Looking at the figure above, the netlist is incorrect. Instead of 
*       of a single "black box" model, LUTS and DFF have been  
*       incorrectly added to represent all the "ports" of the hard block.
*
*       The functions in this file process the .vqm netlist generated by 
*       Quartus synthesis to fix the issues mentioned above.
*       While processing the netlist, if a LUT or DFF 
*       is found, then it is "checked" too see whether it represents a 
*       a hard block "port", if it does then the corresponding hard block
*       the "port" belongs to is identified and 
*       added to the netlist (newly instantiated). The corresponding luts and
*       flip flops are then removed from the netlist and their netlist
*       connections are then appropriately moved to the newly instantiated
*       hard block. 
*
*       For example, if we take the netlist with the "router" block
*       above and we process it using the functions in this file, the
*       router block in the resulting netlist will look as follows:
*                                   
*                                   router_1

 *              - The FPGA architecture is parsed to internally model
 *                each hard block in the design
 *              - The nodes within the netlist are individually processed
 *                to determine whether hard blocks are included within the 
 *                design and then added to the netlist
 *              - The newly added hard blocks are verified to make sure they
 *                are legal
 *              - The luts and dffeas within the netlist that represented
 *                hard block ports are removed 
 * 
 * @param main_module This contains all the netlist information, such as luts,
 *                    flip flops, and other types of blocks. All the nets within
 *                    the netlist are also included.
 * 
 * @param main_arch This contains all the information regarding the FPGA
 *                  architecture that the design will be mapped to. 
 * 
 * @param list_hard_block_type_names A list of the hard block names that need
 *                                   to be properly added to the netlist.
 * 
 * @param arch_file_name Name of the architecture file that contains the FPGA

 *          can be found within the FPGA architecture. For each hard block,
 *          the ports info can be found in a structure called 't_model_ports'
 *          (found in 'logic_types.h'). The ports are arranged in a linked lsit
 *          structure.
 * 
 *          THis function goes through the 't_model_ports' and stores them
 *          within a 't_node_port_association' structure (found in 'vqm_dll.h').
 *          And instead of a linked list, the ports are stored in an array
 *          within a 't_array_ref' structure (found in 'vqm_dll.h'). Finally, 
 *          the port array is stored within the 't_hard_block_port_info'
 *          (found in 'hard_block_recog.h') that is associated to the specific
 *          hard block the ports belong to. 
 * 
 *          We need to do this conversion because the hard blocks that will
 *          eventually added to the netlist will be of type 't_node' and they
 *          store ports in the form of a 't_node_port_association' array. 
 *          Additionally, for ports that are bussed, initially, they were 
 *          represented as a single 't_model_port' structure with the size
 *          of the port included, whereas they need to be seperated into
 *          individual ports (which is also done here).

 *                                   in 'logic_types.h') that represents a port
 *                                   for a hard block.

 *                                  converted too belong to.
 * 
 * @param port_index A tracker variable that indexes each port within the
 *                   port array. For example, if we had 3 ports (test, test_1
 *                   , test_2) and they were sized 1,3,5 respectively. Then

 *                   processing test_1, port_index will be 1, and finally
 *                   port_index will be 5. port index identifies the index at
 *                   which each port starts.
