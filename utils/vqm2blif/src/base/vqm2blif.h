* 			BACKGROUND
*
* VQM is an internal file format used by Altera® inside their development tool,
* Quartus® II. It uses a subset of the Verilog description language, and the 
* circuit it describes is technology-mapped to one of their families of devices 
* (e.g. Stratix® IV or Cyclone® II). These files can be outputted during normal
* Quartus II operation, as detailed in Altera's QUIP documentation.

*
* A .blif netlist is characterized by .models that describe circuit elements.
* Any model has a list of ports (.inputs, .outputs, .clock) and declares flip-flops,
* latches and luts. It also may contain subcircuits, which are instantiations of models 
* declared later in the file. A model being declared as a "blackbox" signifies no 
* knowledge of its inner logic or intraconnections.

 *
 *  model_type:
 *	From VPR's architecture parser, contains data of the model's ports, 
 *	parameters, and modes. 
 *
 *  cnxns:
 *	Describes the intraconnect of the subckt. Maps a port from the model structure
 *	(logic_types.h, VPR) to an association containing pin data (vqm_dll.h, VQM). 
 *	If a port is left open, it will be mapped to the "hbpad" t_node_port_association.
 *	NOTE: Must map the port's name (string) because a port may be a bus, with multiple
 *	wires having the same portname. All assignments in BLIF must be 1-bit wide, so these
 *	buses must be flattened and mapped independantly.
