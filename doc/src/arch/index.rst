FPGA Architecture Description
=============================

VTR uses an XML-based architecture description language to describe the targeted FPGA architecture.
This flexible description langauge allows the user to describe a large number of hypothetical and commercial-like FPGA architectures.

See the :ref:`arch_tutorial` for an introduction to the architecture description langauge.
For a detailed reference on the supported options see the :ref:`arch_reference`.
