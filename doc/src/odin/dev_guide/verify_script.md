# Verify Script

The verify_odin.sh script is designed for generating regression test results. 

./verify_odin.sh [args]

## Examples

The following examples are being performed in the ODIN_II directory:

### Generating Results for a New Task

To generate new results, `synthesis_parse_file` and `simulation_parse_file` must be specified
in task.conf file.

The following commands will generate the results of a new regression test using N processors:

```bash
make sanitize
```

```bash
./verify_odin.sh --generate_expectation -j N -t <regression_test/benchmark/task/<task_name>
```

A synthesis_result.json and a simulation_result.json will be generated in the task's folder.
The simulation results for each benchmark are only generated if they syntehsize correctly (no exit error), thus if none of the benchmarks synthesize there will be no simulation_result.json generated.

### Regenerating Results for a Changed Test

The following commands will only generate the results of the changes.
If there are new benchmarks it will add to the results.
If there are deleted benchmarks or modified benchmarks the results will be updated accordingly.

```bash
make sanitize
```

```bash
./verify_odin.sh --regenerate_expectation -t <regression_test/benchmark/task/<task_name>
```

### Generating Results for a Suite

The following commands generate the results for all the tasks called upon in a suite.

```bash
make sanitize
```

> **NOTE**
>
> If the suite calls upon the large test **DO NOT** run `make sanitize`.
> Instead run `make build`.

```bash
./verify_odin.sh --generate_expectation -t <regression_test/benchmark/suite/<suite_name>
```

### Checking the configuration file

The following commands will check if a configuration file is being read properly.

```bash
make build
```

```bash
./verify_odin.sh --dry_run -t <regression_test/benchmark/<path/to/config_file/difrectory>
```

### Running a subset of tests in a suite

The following commands will run only the tests matching `<test regex>`:

```bash
./verify_odin.sh -t <regression_test/benchmark/suite/<suite_name> <test regex>
```

You may specify as many test regular expressions as desired and the script will run any test that matches at least one regex

> **NOTE**
>
> This uses grep's extended regular expression syntax for matching test names.  
> Test names matched are of the form <suite_name>/<test_name>/<architecture>
