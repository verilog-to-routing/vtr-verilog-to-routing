VTR
===

The Verilog-to-Routing (VTR) project :cite:`luu_vtr,luu_vtr_7` is a world-wide collaborative effort to provide a open-source framework for conducting FPGA architecture and CAD research and development.
The VTR design flow takes as input a Verilog description of a digital circuit, and a description of the target FPGA architecture.

It then perfoms:

 * Elaboration & Synthesis (:ref:`odin_II`)
 * Logic Optimization & Technology Mapping (:ref:`abc`)
 * Packing, Placement, Routing & Timing Analysis (:ref:`vpr`)

Generating FPGA speed and area results.

VTR also includes a set of benchmark designs known to work with the design flow.
